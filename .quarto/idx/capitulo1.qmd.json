Introduction\n\nLa Palma, situated in the westernmost region of the Canary Islands archipelago, represents one of Earth's most active volcanic systems. Located approximately 100 km from the African coast, this Spanish territory exemplifies ongoing oceanic island formation processes.

Since European colonization in the late 1400s, eight major eruptions have been documented, establishing patterns crucial for probabilistic hazard assessment.\n\n| Name                | Year |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Current             | 2021 |\n| Teneguía            | 1971 |\n| Nambroque           | 1949 |\n| El Charco           | 1712 |\n| Volcán San Antonio  | 1677 |\n| Volcán San Martin   | 1646 |\n| Tajuya near El Paso | 1585 |\n| Montaña Quemada     | 1492 |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma\n\nThis equates to an eruption on average every 79 years up until the 1971 event. The probability of a future eruption can be modeled by a Poisson distribution:\n\n$$\np(x)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\lambda$ is the number of eruptions per year, $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{79}$ in this case. The probability of a future eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated by:\n\n$$\np_e = 1-\\mathrm{e}^{-t \\lambda}\n$$\n\nSo following the 1971 eruption the probability of an eruption in the following 50 years — the period ending this year — was 0.469. After the event, the number of eruptions per year moves to $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{75}$ and the probability of a further eruption within the next 50 years (2022-2071) rises to 0.487 and in the next 100 years, this rises again to 0.736.\n\n### Theoretical Framework: Multi-Reservoir Magma Systems\n\nPrevious geophysical and petrological investigations have proposed a conceptual model involving two primary magma storage zones beneath Cumbre Vieja:\n\n1.  **Deep mantle reservoir** (30-40 km depth): Primary magma storage and differentiation zone\n2.  **Shallow crustal reservoir** (10-20 km depth): Secondary storage feeding eruptions\n\nThis hierarchical system suggests that magma ascends from the deep reservoir, undergoes further processing in the shallow chamber, and eventually reaches the surface during eruptions.

The dataset encompasses the critical period from September 11 to November 9, 2021, capturing pre-eruptive, syn-eruptive, and post-eruptive phases.\n\n### Data Processing and Quality Control\n\nRaw seismic catalogs were processed using automated web scraping protocols to ensure reproducibility and systematic data collection. Quality control measures included verification of event locations, magnitudes, and depth determinations.\n\n### Analytical Framework\n\nStatistical analysis focused on: - Spatial distribution of hypocenters - Temporal evolution of seismic activity - Depth-magnitude relationships - Clustering analysis for reservoir identification\n\n# 3. Results and Analysis\n\n### Dataset Characteristics\n\nAnalysis of the complete IGN catalog yielded 5,465 seismic events specifically attributed to La Palma during the study period. These data were systematically analyzed across multiple dimensions: spatial distribution, temporal evolution, magnitude characteristics, and depth clustering patterns.\n\n### Evidence for Multi-Reservoir System\n\nOur comprehensive analysis reveals three distinct seismic signatures that strongly support the proposed multi-reservoir magma system:\n\n#### Pre-Eruptive Shallow Swarm Activity\n\nIntense earthquake swarms occurred in the shallow subsurface (\\< 10 km depth) during the weeks preceding the September 19th eruption onset. This activity correlates with significant surface deformation measurements and indicates shallow magma intrusion processes.\n\n#### Syn- and Post-Eruptive Crustal Reservoir Activity\n\nFollowing eruption initiation, continuous moderate-magnitude seismicity established at 10-15 km depth, consistent with ongoing magma movement within the proposed shallow crustal reservoir. This persistent activity suggests active magma storage and transport processes.\n\n#### Deep Mantle Reservoir Signatures\n\nHigh-magnitude seismic events (M \\> 4.0) occurred systematically at 30-40 km depths throughout the study period. These deeper events, while less frequent than shallow activity, demonstrate continuous activity within the proposed deep mantle reservoir system.\n\n# 4. Discussion\n\n### Validation of Multi-Reservoir Models\n\nThe seismic evidence presented strongly validates theoretical multi-reservoir magma storage models previously proposed for Cumbre Vieja. The bimodal depth distribution of earthquakes, with distinct clustering at shallow (10-15 km) and deep (30-40 km) levels, provides compelling observational support for hierarchical magma storage systems.\n\n### Implications for Volcanic Hazard Assessment\n\nUnderstanding magma reservoir architecture has direct implications for eruption forecasting:\n\n-   **Deep reservoir monitoring**: High-magnitude events at mantle depths may serve as long-term eruption precursors\n-   **Shallow reservoir dynamics**: Swarm activity in the crustal reservoir provides short-term eruption warnings\n-   **System connectivity**: Temporal relationships between deep and shallow activity indicate reservoir interaction\n\n### Methodological Advances\n\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of systematic seismic catalog analysis for validating geophysical models.
