capabilities of each technique using:\n\n- **Contrast Transfer Function (CTF)** analysis\n- **Spectral Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR)** calculations  \n- **Phase reconstruction fidelity** metrics\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n#### Contrast Transfer Function (CTF)\n\nThe CTF describes how different spatial frequencies are transferred from the object to the image:\n\n$$\nCTF(k) = \\sin(\\chi(k))\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi(k)$ is the aberration function.\n\n#### Spectral Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR)\n\nSSNR quantifies the quality of phase information transfer:\n\n$$\nSSNR(k) = \\frac{|F_{signal}(k)|^2}{|F_{noise}(k)|^2}\n$$\n\n## Results\n\n### Contrast Transfer Function Analysis\n\nOur CTF analysis reveals that direct ptychographic methods provide the most uniform information transfer across all spatial frequencies.\n\n### Signal-to-Noise Ratio Analysis\n\nSSNR calculations demonstrate that:\n\n1. **Center-of-mass imaging** excels at low spatial frequencies\n2. **Tilt-corrected bright-field STEM** offers balanced performance\n3. **Direct ptychographic methods** achieve superior high-frequency performance\n\n### Impact of Experimental Parameters\n\nKey factors affecting performance include:\n\n- **Scan sampling effects**: Higher sampling improves reconstruction quality\n- **Aberration sensitivity**: Direct methods are more robust to aberrations\n- **Detector geometry**: Optimization critical for all techniques\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Advantages of SSNR Metrics\n\nSSNR provides a more comprehensive evaluation than traditional CTF analysis by:\n\n- Incorporating noise characteristics\n- Accounting for experimental conditions\n- Enabling quantitative comparisons\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n#### Method Selection Guidelines\n\n- **For routine imaging**: Center-of-mass techniques offer simplicity\n- **For high-resolution work**: Direct ptychographic methods preferred\n- **For specific applications**: Tilt-corrected methods provide balanced approach\n\n#### Experimental Optimization\n\nOptimal performance requires careful consideration of:\n- Probe conditions and aberrations\n- Detector design and positioning  \n- Scan

high-resolution phase imaging\n2. **SSNR analysis** provides valuable insights beyond traditional CTF evaluation\n3. **Method selection** should consider specific experimental requirements and
