The method employs advanced algorithms to separate aberration contributions from genuine specimen-related phase information.\n\n**Technical specifications:**\n- Multi-angle acquisition protocols\n- Advanced aberration correction algorithms\n- Optimized for routine high-throughput applications\n\n### Direct Ptychographic Methods\n\nDirect ptychography represents the most computationally intensive but potentially most powerful approach, reconstructing both object and probe functions simultaneously from overlapping diffraction patterns. This method offers superior resolution and phase sensitivity through iterative optimization algorithms.\n\n**Performance characteristics:**\n- Highest achievable spatial resolution\n- Quantitative phase reconstruction\n- Optimal for research applications requiring maximum information content\n\n# 3. Methods and Analysis Framework\n\n### Experimental Design and Data Collection\n\nOur systematic evaluation employed standardized experimental protocols to ensure meaningful comparisons across all three phase retrieval methods.

Results and Analysis\n\n### Comprehensive Performance Assessment\n\nOur systematic evaluation across multiple experimental conditions and specimen types provides definitive guidance for method selection and optimization strategies.\n\n### Contrast Transfer Function Analysis\n\nCTF analysis reveals fundamental differences in spatial frequency response across the three methods:\n\n**Direct ptychographic methods** demonstrate the most uniform information transfer across all spatial frequencies, with consistent performance from low-frequency structural information to high-frequency atomic details. This uniformity represents a significant advantage for quantitative analysis applications.\n\n**Center-of-mass imaging** exhibits optimal performance at low to moderate spatial frequencies, making it ideal for applications requiring rapid structural characterization without atomic-level detail.\n\n**Tilt-corrected bright-field STEM** provides intermediate performance with excellent stability across moderate spatial frequencies, offering the optimal balance for routine analytical applications.\n\n### Signal-to-Noise Ratio Analysis\n\nSSNR calculations provide critical insights into practical performance under realistic experimental conditions:\n\n1. **Center-of-mass imaging**: Exceptional performance at low spatial frequencies with minimal noise amplification\n2. **Tilt-corrected bright-field STEM**: Balanced performance across all frequencies with robust noise handling\n3. **Direct ptychographic methods**: Superior high-frequency performance with advanced noise management algorithms\n\n### Experimental Parameter Sensitivity\n\nCritical factors affecting performance across all methods include:\n\n- **Scan sampling effects**: Systematic correlation between sampling density and reconstruction quality\n- **Aberration sensitivity**: Direct methods demonstrate superior robustness to optical aberrations\n- **Detector geometry optimization**: Performance critically dependent on detector configuration for all techniques\n- **Computational resource requirements**: Significant variation in processing demands across methods\n\n# 5.
